# Currency Exchange Rate Auto Alerts 

## Objective
As the world becomes more integrated, we are more connected than ever. More students study abroad and more people travel around the globe. 
For this reason, I created an automated notification system for currency exchange where you can get a Twitter alert when the exchange rate of designated currency drops or goes up.
With this algorithm, you will be able to save some travel money!

## How it works
My algorithm is programmed to get the exchange rate from yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/) every 5 hours. This information is automatically shared with the users on Twitter.
